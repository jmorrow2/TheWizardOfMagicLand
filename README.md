# TheWizardOfMagicLand
 2D top-down style magic shooter game
 
 I built this game using Java and it is the first game I ever made.
 The player is a wizard with a variety of elemental magic powers that they use to defeat an onslaught of enemy monsters.
 Enemies were implemented with unique movement patterns and sound effects.  
 Originally the game was going to have multiple levels, more magic, and more enemies but due to time constraints the current implementation is one endless level where the player attempts to beat their highscore.
